# Interview-Question-Management-System
The inspiration behind making this platform was to ease the difficulties faced by students who are preparing for internships or placements. Sometimes it gets very intimidating when you look at the skills and topics that you might need for a job, but if placed students can contribute the questions asked to them during their interview, it would help the amateurs a great deal.
